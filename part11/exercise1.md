Let’s say we’re working on a Python app , and want to set the entire CI/CD pipeline up before releasing it. 

In the CI pipeline, we use Ruff for linting and formatting, which is a fast all-in-one formatter and linter developed in Rust. It checks our code for errors and enforces style rules. For the testing suite, we use Pytest. 

We containerize the project with Docker using the Dockerfile, which will handle the build process. For our CI/CD setup, we use Azure DevOps Pipelines, which integrates well with Azure Container Registry to track Docker images and handle the release and deployment processes. Jenkins and GitHub Actions are also popular CI tools, and even more alternatives exist such as GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, and Travis CI. Since we’re only dealing with this one app, a cloud-based solution is perfect. It’s easy to set up, scales as needed, and we don’t have to worry about maintaining servers. However, if we had more complex needs or multiple projects, a self-hosted solution like Jenkins could be worth considering. However, since it is complex to setup, it is unlikely be worth it for our use. For now, a cloud-based approach like Azure DevOps is our best bet.
